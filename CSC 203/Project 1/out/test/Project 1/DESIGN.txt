moveEntity(WorldModel world, Entity entity, Point pos)
- I elected to move this to the WorldModel class instead of Entity, because it uses private instance methods of WorldModel

setBackgroundCell(WorldModel world, Point pos, Background background),

- I moved these methods to WorldModel instead of Background, because

getCurrentImage
- not sure what to do about this one

setBackground(WorldModel world, Point pos, Background background)
- I moved this to WorldModel instead of Background, because the background is apart of the WorldModel. Since it must be
changed after the compiler goes inside the current world, it should be a method within WorldModel
