moveEntity
- I elected to move this to the WorldModel class instead of Entity, because it uses private instance methods of WorldModel

setBackgroundCell

- I moved these methods to WorldModel instead of Background, because

getCurrentImage
- not sure what to do about this one

setBackground
- I moved this to WorldModel instead of Background, because the background is apart of the WorldModel. Since it must be
changed after the compiler goes inside the current world, it should be a method within WorldModel

addEntity
- I added this to WorldModel instead of the Entity class because the method will check the bounds and occupancy of
certain cells in the world, instead of just a singular entity

transformNotFull, transfromFull, transformPlant, transformTree
- I added these methods to WorldModel instead of Entity, because while it uses and creates Entity instances, it checkes
the world at the given point, and adds there, wich makes it a WorldModel method

createAnimationAction, createActivityAction
- Not sure
transformPlant, transformTree, transformSapling
- I put these in WorldModel instead of Entity or Action, because transformPlants calls trasnformTree, which calls the
removeEntity method that is in WorldModel
createActivityAction
- Although this doesn't take an EventSchedule, it is only used in or with calling the EventSchedule
