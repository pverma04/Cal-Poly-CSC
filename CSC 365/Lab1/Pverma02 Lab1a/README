Hi! Please run this program, and it will go on until you enter Q for quit. 
There are a variety of commands that can be used:
S[tudent]: <lastname>
S[tudent]: <lastname> B[us]
T[eacher]: <lastname>
G[rade]: <Number>
B[us]: <Number>
G[rade]: <Number> H[igh] or G[rade]: <Number> L[ow]
A[verage]: <Number>
I[nfo]
Q[uit]

Each command will print the specified output after fetching the data requested.
Invalid requests will state that it is invalid, and let you re enter.

Thank you!
