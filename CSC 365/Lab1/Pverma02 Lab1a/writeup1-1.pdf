• Initial decisions: programming language, development environment;
    - Chose to use python, as I have not in a while. COded in VSCode as standard

• Notes on your chosen internal architecture: what data structures you used, for what purposes;
    - Made a class for students, each student is an object
    - Used a library to store students by last name keys. 
    - Each last name holds a value of a list of all student objects with that last name attribute

• Task log. For each task to be completed, list the name of the task, the student(s) performing it, approximate total person-hours it took to complete. You do not have to document every method or function.
    - I did everything, it took me about two days in total.

• Notes on testing. When, who, how long, how many bugs found, how long it took to fix them.
    - My main issue was with the Average command and the typecasting
      to properly calculate, and round the value to two digits
    - This took me about 20 minutes to sort out, with some trial and error, and online searches

• Final notes (anything else you want to share with me about your implementation)
    - Nothing in particular.
    - I hope it works well and you like it! Thank you professor.
