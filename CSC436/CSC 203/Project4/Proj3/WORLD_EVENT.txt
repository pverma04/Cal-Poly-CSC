1. To trigger the event, click on any side of the main entity (Aang, the orange guy, of the Tree class)
2. Aang will shoot airballs on the side you click on (left, right, up, or down)
3. If the airballs hit an enemy entity, the enemy entity will turn into a fireball (DudeFull class) and jump into
the nearest firepit (Obstacle class).
4. When you hit a dragon (DudeNotFull class) or Prince Zuko (Fairy class), a new dragon spawns from a randomized
corner of the world. Every 4 enemies you kill, a new Prince Zuko spawns from a randomized corner of the world as well.

DudeNotFull, and Fairy classes.
Parth Verma - implemented Dijkstra, implemented Factory Design Pattern, edited Tree class, cursor key functionality
